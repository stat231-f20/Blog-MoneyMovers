# Introduction

The world of finance has a multitude of moving parts that make the industry so interesting and intriguing. 
Talk about what is an IPO, why should we care about IPOs etc
-IPOs are fundamental part of the finance industry
-IPO=Initial Public Offering

## Goal
Through our analysis, we hope to examine different characteristics of IPOs and determine whether there are more similar characteristics found in this group of IPOs, which could be helpful to determine if a company has a higher prbability of becoming an IPO. Such characteristics being observed include year the compnay went public, the sector of the company, where the company is mainly located, as well as its current stock trends.

#Data
Our data comes from two main soruces. We first used a CSV from kaggle which included IPOs from the years 1996 to 2018. The kaggle dataset included many different characteristics of each of the IPOs. These characteristics include and the high and low for the first 261 days of being public.
-Where did your data come from?
  -kaggle
-What kind of data is it?
  -csv +web scraping
      -csv of basic characteristic of thousands of IPOs
      -web scraping inlcudes stock prices of 200 randomized of the given IPOs
-Is there a link to the data

#Limitations
-Dataset based on data from 2018


## Header 2

### Header 3

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-MoneyMovers to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)

## Map of the Distribution of Location of IPOs

You can embed code as normal, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
IPO <- read_csv("IPOList.csv")

usa_states <- map_data(map = "state", region = ".") 

counted_stocks <- IPO %>%
  group_by(stateCountry)%>%
  summarise(tot_stocks = length(unique(Symbol)))

key <- data.frame(
  state_abbrev = c("AL", "AK", "AZ", "AR", "CA", "CO", "CT", "DE", "FL", "GA", "HI", "ID", "IL", "IN", "IA", "KS", "KY", "LA", "ME", "MD", "MA", "MI", "MN", "MS", "MO", "MT", "NE", "NV", "NH", "NJ", "NM", "NY", "NC", "ND", "OH", "OK", "OR", "PA", "RI", "SC", "SD", "TN", "TX", "UT", "VT", "VA", "WA", "WV", "WI", "WY"),
  
  state_fullname = c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maine", "Maryland", "Massachusetts", "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Mississippi", "Missouri", "Montana", "Nebraska", "Nevada", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New Mexico", "New York", "North Carolina", "North Dakota", "Ohio", "Oklahoma", "Oregon", "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island", "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas", "Utah", "Vermont", "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", "Wyoming")
  
)
view(key)

Joined_data <- left_join(counted_stocks, key, by = c("stateCountry" = "state_abbrev"))
view(Joined_data)

final_data <- Joined_data %>%
  mutate(state_fullname = tolower(state_fullname)) %>%
  left_join(usa_states, by = c("state_fullname" = "region"))

view(final_data)


ggplot(final_data, aes(map_id = state_fullname)) +
  geom_map(aes(fill = tot_stocks), map = usa_states) +
  expand_limits(x = usa_states$long, y = usa_states$lat) + 
  theme_void() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.3) +
  labs(fill = "Number of IPOs by US State")
```

Let's clean up the format of that output:

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Speed of car (mph)"
       , y = "Distance taken to stop (ft)"
       , title = "cars data (1920s)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
